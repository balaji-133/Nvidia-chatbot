## 📖 About the Topic
This project implements an intelligent conversational agent leveraging **Nvidia's AI stack** (such as Nvidia NeMo, Riva, or TensorRT). The chatbot is designed to utilize GPU acceleration to provide low-latency, high-accuracy responses. It demonstrates the capability of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) when optimized on Nvidia hardware, handling natural language understanding and generation efficiently.

## 🚀 Why This Project?
In the rapidly evolving landscape of Generative AI, standard CPU-based inference can often be too slow for real-time applications. This project was created to:
* Explore the performance gains of **GPU-accelerated inference**.
* Demonstrate how to integrate Nvidia's specific tools into a practical Python workflow.
* Solve the problem of slow response times and high-latency interactions in standard chatbot deployments.

## ✨ Advantages
* **High Performance:** Optimized for CUDA cores, ensuring rapid token generation and response times.
* **Scalability:** Built to handle multiple concurrent requests without significant lag.
* **Customizability:** Easily adaptable to different datasets or domain-specific knowledge bases.
* **Privacy-Focused:** Designed to run locally or on private clouds, keeping data secure and off third-party public servers.
